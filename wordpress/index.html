		<hr>

		<h3 id="settings"><strong>B) Settings and Options</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Here's the overview of the Scrollside Settings' fields:</p>

		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Name</th>
					<th>Type</th>
					<th>Default</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Scrollside selector</td>
					<td>CSS selector</td>
					<td>#secondary</td>
					<td>A <code>.class-name</code>, <code>#id-attribute</code> or any CSS selector for the sidebar's container that'll become a scrollside, or any selector for the sidebar if you doesn't have an outer sidebar.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Row selector</td>
					<td>CSS selector</td>
					<td>#main</td>
					<td>CSS selector for the row's element that contains the sidebar, main content's element and the other element(s) if any. Just set to <code>.row</code> if your theme is using Bootstrap grid system.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Sidebar selector</td>
					<td>CSS selector</td>
					<td>>:first-child</td>
					<td>CSS selector for the sidebar that's inside of the sidebar's container or outer sidebar a.k.a. scrollside. By default, it will select the first child element of the scrollside to be the sidebar. If your sidebar doesn't have an outer container, you can just put your sidebar's selector (not the default <code>>:first-child</code> one) in both "Scrollside selector" and "Sidebar selector" fields.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Mobile width</td>
					<td>number or <code>'true'</code> or <code>'false'</code></td>
					<td>true</td>
					<td>The max-width in pixels, of the document for mobile view where the sidebar's top-margin will set back to its original position and will start moving again when the viewport become above it. Just set to <code>true</code> for automatic mobile width or if your theme is using Bootstrap grid system, or <code>false</code> for forever moving sidebar.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Mobile animate</td>
					<td><code>'auto'</code>, <code>'css'</code> or <code>'scroll'</code></td>
					<td>auto</td>
					<td>Mobile animation will only perform if the desktop view become mobile view. The default <code>auto</code> will automatically scroll back the sidebar to its original position. Setting to <code>css</code> will auto statically set back the sidebar without animation. And <code>scroll</code> is just like the <code>auto</code> but the animation will only perform when you scroll.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Top padding</td>
					<td>number</td>
					<td>15</td>
					<td>A non-literal top padding or an additional margin-top in pixels, of the sidebar when it's moving.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Top padding decrement</td>
					<td>negative number</td>
					<td>-15</td>
					<td>Must be a negative number, it's the "Top padding" decrementation if the sidebar's bottom reach the row's bottom. It's very useful if your row's element is unexpectedly increasing its height due to the reaching of the moving sidebar on its bottom.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Scroll duration</td>
					<td>number or the string <code>'fast'</code> or <code>'slow'</code></td>
					<td>400</td>
					<td>Milliseconds to complete the sidebar's moving animation per scroll. The strings <code>fast</code> and <code>slow</code> can be supplied to indicate durations of 200 and 600 milliseconds.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Mobile duration</td>
					<td>number</td>
					<td>2000</td>
					<td>Milliseconds to complete the moving back to the original position of the sidebar if the desktop view become mobile view. And will only effect when the "Mobile animate" is not set to <code>css</code>.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<p>The minimal options that you can provide without touching the other defaults:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><b>Scrollside selector</b> - Providing the CSS selector for your sidebar's container in the "Scrollside selector" field. If your sidebar doesn't have an outer sidebar or not inside of a container that's specifically build for it, then you can just apply the selector for your sidebar in this field.</li>
			<li><b>Row selector</b> - Providing the CSS selector for the row's element that contains your sidebar, sidebar's container or scrollside, main content's element and the other element(s) if any.</li>
			<li><b>Sidebar selector</b> - You can leave the "Sidebar selector" in its default if the first child of the sidebar's container that you have selected in your "Scrollside selector" is the sidebar, but anyway you can specify it if necessary.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>A few things to consider if your theme is using <strong>Bootstrap 12-column grid system</strong>:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Choose the element with a Bootstrap predefined grid <code>col-*-*</code> class to be your sidebar's container, to input its unique CSS selector in the "Scrollside selector" field.</li>
			<li>Set the "Row selector" field to <code>.row</code> , it's a Bootstrap predefined grid class for a row's element.</li>
			<li>Leave the "Mobile width" to <code>true</code> to make the mobile responsiveness rely in a predefined grid <code>col-*-*</code> class of your scrollside.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="selectingElements"><strong>C) Selecting Elements</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>It's a good practice if your sidebar is inside of a container which is known as a sidebar's container or outer sidebar and that container is inside of a row's element that contains the other column(s) including the main content. In case your sidebar doesn't have an outer container, don't worry, you can input your sidebar's selector in both "Scrollside selector" and "Sidebar selector" fields.</p>

		<p>Lets say we will configure our plugin to "Add New Scrollside" for a <strong>Twenty Fourteen</strong> theme:</p>

		<a href="demo.jpg"><img src="demo.jpg" alt="Demo"></a><br><br>

		<p>We can find the element of the row that we need by starting to point our mouse to the very top content of our target sidebar, click the right mouse button then after that, click "Inspect element":</p>

		<a href="inspect-element.jpg"><img src="inspect-element.jpg" alt="Inspect Element"></a><br><br>

		<p>Here's the example that you'll going to see after the previous instruction:</p>

		<a href="inspected-element.jpg"><img src="inspected-element.jpg" alt="Inspected Element"></a><br><br>

		<p>Now try to point or left click your mouse to the HTML element that contains your sidebar, main content and other column(s) if any, and the easiest is to get its unique identifier, ID attribute or class name. In our example the identifier that we will choose is the ID "main" and we will need to precede it with # because it's an ID attribute, to make it an ID selector like <code><b>#main</b></code> which we will going to input in our <b>"Row selector"</b>.</p>

		<a href="inspecting-row.jpg"><img src="inspecting-row.jpg" alt="Inspecting Row"></a><br><br>

		<p>And because the Twenty Fourteen theme doesn't have a sidebar's container, we will just get the selector for our sidebar to input in our "Scrollside selector". To get that, we need to point our mouse on our sidebar's element that's inside of our row and get its identifier, we will get the ID "secondary" and precede it with # like <code><b>#secondary</b></code> and apply that selector in our <b>"Scrollside selector"</b>.</p>

		<a href="inspecting-scrollside.jpg"><img src="inspecting-scrollside.jpg" alt="Inspecting Scrollside"></a><br><br>

		<p>And because the selector that we've inputed to our "Scrollside selector" is for our sidebar, we will also need to input <code><b>#secondary</b></code> in our <b>"Sidebar selector"</b> where it truly belongs.</p>

		<p>The selectors that we got are <code>#main</code> for our "Row selector" and <code>#secondary</code> for our "Sidebar selector" and for our "Scrollside selector" <b>because</b> we don't have a sidebar's container. There are many kinds of selectors that we can use to select the elements that we need, but the two basic selectors that we can easily used are an ID selector that preceded with # like <code>#id</code> and a class selector that preceded with a dot like <code>.class</code>, for more info please visit: <a href="https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/">https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/</a></p>

		<h3 id="otherFeatures"><strong>D) Other Features</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Here are some features that need an overview:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>You can add multiple Scrollside Settings for different sidebars, delete a scrollside or modify it.</li>
			<li>In case you have two different sidebars with the same class name in a single row, you can just add a single scrollside for those two sidebar by providing their "Row selector" and a class selector for the "Scrollside selector" and the "Sidebar selector".</li>
			<li>If the row's height is unexpectedly increasing when the sidebar's bottom is reaching the row's bottom (this may be happened if the sidebar isn't the first child element of the scrollside), then you can try to make the "Top padding decrement" more negatively like -50, -100 or more depends on the added top or bottom margin or padding by your inner or outer sidebar or the other element(s).</li>
			<li>It's Bootstrap 12-column grid system compatible! Just set the right selectors and set the "Mobile width" to <code>true</code> and the plugin will track the class prefix <code>.col-*-</code> of your scrollside as its mobile width.</li>
		</ul>
